    With 9.0.0 dependency-check has moved from using the NVD data-feed to the NVD API.<br>
    Users of dependency-check are <b>highly</b> encouraged to obtain an NVD API Key;
    see https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key<br>
    Without an NVD API Key dependency-check's updates will be <b>extremely slow</b>.

    <b>The NVD API Key, CI, and Rate Limiting</b><br>
    The NVD API has enforced rate limits. If you are using a single API KEY and multiple builds occur you could hit the rate limit and receive 403 errors.<br>
    <u>In a CI environment one must use a caching strategy or use a set API KEY to use for different jobs.</u>
